# Pingo
A small bingo style mobile game made in AndroidStudio 2018/2019.

Back in my Grammar School, we had a teacher who was known for going on tangents while teaching, and going on the same tangents very often. 
This game is a bingo with the different topics that he would touch upon in class. The premise is simple: When he touches upon a topic, 
the player tags the topic in the app. All the standard bingo win conditions apply.

The appalso allowed for adding and deleting topics from the database to allow for customisation, as there were topics specific to our class,
and the game was meant to be playable by anyone who had this teacher for any class.

The app was built in AndroidStudio, and served me well to learn how to develop knowledge of mobile app development, as well as improving my 
programming skills. I had to research concepts I have never come across before, such as Android app Activity, Shared Preferences, and more.
